### My-Devops-Project
- I've started this project as a means to apply and learn the various infrastructural and operational components that you might encounter in a software development environment practicing devops principles

### The application
- This is a python application in a `Docker` container backed by a `Postgres` deployed into `Kubernetes` with templates defined in `Helm` charts into an `AWS EKS` cluster
- The focus of this project is not on the application Itself.This is not a development project.The code exists solely to mock some of the functionaity you may see in a real project

### Application design requirements
- 12 factor Architecture.Read [here](https://12factor.net/)
- Microservice application design
- Basic monitoring and alerting
- Logging sent to a centralsed source
- Automated SDLC (CI/CD)
- Publicly accessible via SSL secured endpoint
